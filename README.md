Scenario

You will be acting as a high school teacher who wants to become more efficient in sending out grades to your students. Students have just answered 3 questions on an assigned book. You’d like to send everyone an email with their scores on each question along with any comments you have. Additionally, you’d like to pick a student at random to talk about the book in front of the class.

As you are grading, you maintain an Excel spreadsheet of student names and emails, and populate it with a breakdown of each question score and any comments you may have to the student. You’ll write a program that can automatically grab this information and send out a customized email to each student containing their score and comments. Additionally, if they were randomly chosen to present, you’ll mention this in their email message as well.

Techniques

Understanding how an email message is structured and sent
Reading documentation for a Python library you’ve never seen before
Parsing a CSV file to extract and store information in a relevant data structure
